This game was made in two months with a team of 3 at University of Alabama Huntsville.

The division of labor is in a document in this folder, if you want to see who does want.

This version of the game however is corrupted and one of the triggers for moving to the next floor is missing.
I currently can't find the old file. Will re upload when fixed.

Controls:
Move with W,A,S,D. Use the mouse to open menues and choose commands in combat

Hope you enjoy,
